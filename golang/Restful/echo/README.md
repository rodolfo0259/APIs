# Echos of the past

You are in an abondoned goverment office in the abondoned city of Valkyria, this place is the pinpointed location that your grandpa left in his journal that he gave to you before he passed way.
The story books say that the city was abondoned because the government announced that the local mountain that had a strong landslide release a strong and toxic gas to all living beings, and at the time, theyu evacuated everyone without notice or date to going back

Since the city was small and having some financial problems inside the state affairs, they decided to close the city and compensate the citizens

But your grandpa journal says different, the gas that leaked into the city, was about a government experiment that was happening inside the mountain, that could have gonne very wrong, and they needed to take more abrupt measures...


Your job is to search the pinpointed location, the abandoned office, for clues of what happened
