# Collection of API's

Repo to save API's types like Restful, Websockets, SOAP, gRPC, GraphQL, in different languages like Golang, Java, Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc


## How to use :blue_book:
This repo is separated by folder with the programming language name in which an API type was implemented, for example, in the folder "golang" there will be a folder called "Restful" meaning a API of the Restful type, developed using Golang and inside the API type, can be another folder containing the technology used to develop it, like Gin or Echo

```
Folder: golang/Restful/echo/...
Folder: python/GraphQL/...
```
